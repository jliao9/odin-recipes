    <h1>Cozy Chicken Wings </h1>
    <p><img src = "../images/chicken_wings.jpg" alt="Picture of Chicken Wings"></p>
    <h2><p> Description: </h2> </p>
    <p>Growing up, buffalo wild wings and wingstop were my favorite restaurants to buy wings. However, the cost associated with frequenting these comfort food shops have significantly risen.</p>
    <p>With this recipe, we can skip the line (and the price) and make our beloved chicken wings from the comfort of our homes at a fraction of the cost!</p>
    <p>Instead of frying the wings, this recipe will cook the wings in the oven, which is significantly healthier and also more convenient! Read on for more details.</p>
    <h2><p> Ingredients:</p></h2>
    <p> <ul>
        <li>Fresh chicken wings</li>
        <li>Butter (unsalted or salted are both fine) <em>Alternative: Oil instead of butter</em></li>
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
        <li> Spices of your choice (we prefer garlic powder and paprika)</li>
    </ul>
    </p><h2> Steps: </h2>
    <p> <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 400°F
        <li>Toss the wings in melted butter (or small amounts of oil) and sprinkle them with spices of your choice. </li>
        <li> Arrange the wings on a baking sheet fitted into a wire rack. </li>
        <li> Bake wings until fully cooked and crispy (Usually around 40 minutes in a 400°F oven). </li>
        <li> After fully cooked, lower oven temperature to 170°F and allow the wings to sit for 30-60 more minutes.</li>
        <li> Enjoy! </li>
    </ol></p>
