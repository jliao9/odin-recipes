    <p> What screams "cozy at home vibes" more than s'mores? </p>
    <p> Made with just graham crackers, chocolate, and marshmallows, this treat is simple yet delicious.</p>

        <li> Place one square chocolate on each cracker</li>
        <li> Place one standard sized-marshmallow on top of each piece of chocolate </li>
